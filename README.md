# Facial-Landmarks-Detection using Deep Learning(CNNs)
Here the following code with generate the 15 landmarks of face(left_eye_center, right_eye_center, left_eye_inner_corner, 
left_eye_outer_corner, right_eye_inner_corner, right_eye_outer_corner, left_eyebrow_inner_end, left_eyebrow_outer_end, 
right_eyebrow_inner_end, right_eyebrow_outer_end, nose_tip, mouth_left_corner, mouth_right_corner, mouth_center_top_lip, 
mouth_center_bottom_lip).

You can also apply different types of filters on your face like different types of Glasses.Here i had used 6 different types of Glasses.
In the above code the filters I had used are 6 different types of Glasses which can be changed by just waving a blue colored material
in your OpenCV image Window.
This changing of the glasses is done using color filtering using Open CV.
You can add different types of filters in the filters portion of the code.
This code is built for filters which can be applied in front of eyes, you can change the position if you want to apply different 
types of filters in the code(in place of sunglasses in the code file)

Facial Landmarks detection can also be used for various purposes like:-

Facial feature detection improves face recognition
